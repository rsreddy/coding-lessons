### UPDATE
We've created a lot of lessons for teaching coding at [MV Code Club](https://www.mvcodeclub.com/lessons)  You are welcome to use these lessons for [personal use](https://www.mvcodeclub.com/content-license) for no cost.  I wasn't happy with just using markdown, it didn't provide enough expressiveness, so we built our own website and tool for this.


Coding Lessons
==============
A repository for coding lessons I am teaching

Currently, I am teaching a few 4th graders an intro to coding class.


Check out [4th-grade-coding](https://github.com/tarr11/coding-lessons/tree/master/4th-grade-coders) for more information on the curriculum.

I am also blogging about the actual class experience on [my personal website](http://douglastarr.com/mvcoders.html)



## MIT License
You are welcome to use, copy, fork, these lessons.  

I believe coding curricula works best when it's open.  

So, feel free to add comments, pull requests, etc, for things that you think work better or worse.

## Help
If you are teaching a coding class and have curricula to share, please let me know and I'll link to it!
